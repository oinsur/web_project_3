        Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your
        country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You will pass through 
        12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a 
        selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by
        famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

              <p class="place__text">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and highly 
              underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure 
              not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.</p>
              <p class="place__text">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in 
              the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack 
              from for your 3_month expedition.</p>
              <p class="place__text">Average cost: $80-100.</p>

              serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the 
              South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
              <p class="place__text">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra 
              footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from 
              this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots 
              to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the 
              Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

                going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been 
                home to the world_famous General Electric Company.</p>
              <p class="place__text">This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting 
                energy. So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help 
                you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10_20.</p>

                time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most 
                famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania
                also has produced a rather decent_sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
              <p class="place__text">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed 
                up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania_based company. Most likely, one of the 
                tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the 
                National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>
              <p class="place__text">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

                hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which 
                have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking 
                this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK 
                your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete 
                (provided you can stomach it). Take a much_deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before 
                continue your bike ride!</p>
