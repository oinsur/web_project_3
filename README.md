# Practicum Project 3: From Portland to Portland
## Summary
This is the third project. It is about a bike trip across the USA. The route goes from Portland ME, to Portland OR.
This project contains some elements which were not used in previous projects.  
### These consist of the following:
* Media queries
* Web fonts
* Grids
 
## Layout and organization
All the sections are contained in their own blocks and some of the content is arranged within each block using the flexbox property.
Some of the images are arranged using Grid.

## File Management
Each block has a folder with a respective CSS file which contains the styles which are applied to that block. All stylesheets are imported  
into the index.css file. This helps to keep the stylesheet organized and also helps the html page to load faster.  

## Improvements and modifications
I have really learned a lot with this project. I have had to work more on this project than the other two previous porjects. I hope to get some feedback about how to improve the project.
